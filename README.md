## CrCl Calculator Application  

### Project Summary  
This project is an creatine clearance calculator for mobile devices developed in React Native. Measuring creatine clearance is important for medical professionals for treating patients with Renal disease and providing the correct dosage for varying drugs. This project calculates the creatine clearance based on patient measurement information and provides dosage values based on the calculated results. The dosage values and drugs are listed in the PDF file for reference. <br>

### Project Operation
The project is split into two primary elements. The first element is the React Native that contains the logic that calculates the creatine clearance value and retrieves the prescription information. The second element is the JSON file that is a readable version of the PDF of the drugs that require accurate dosage values. Getting accurate dosage values is critical for Renal disease as incorrect dosage can result in the patient receiving the side effects from the drugs within the patient without actually treating the ailment. <br>
